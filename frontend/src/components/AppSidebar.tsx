// The nav, and the first entry is the product. "home" is a fixed id rather than the
// feature's name so that a fork replacing this template's demo feature replaces the
// CONTENTS of HomePage.tsx and the title and icon on this line — a bookmark to "/"
// still lands on whatever that product's own screen is. LED is what Strux ships as
// its worked example; a real product's first entry is its own thing.
//
// There is no "Device" entry: a chip name and a heap figure are reference material
// you go looking for, not a destination, so they live behind the footer instead of
// taking a place in the navigation beside the product. See

// Two of them carry a `hint`, and only those two: Console and Commands both look

// printed, the other is what you asked it. Naming the difference in the nav is
// cheaper than finding it out by clicking.
