// What this product is, and how it is meant to be driven — in the product's own
// words, in the application layer, beside the managers the words are about.
//
// It lives here and not in the relay for one reason: whatever answers "how do I use
// this device" has to be the firmware that is actually running. A copy kept
// server-side is a copy that describes last month's build, and the one caller who
// cannot notice is the one most likely to act on it.
//
// Registered into the framework from AppContext::Init(), like every other thing the
// application tells Strux about itself (see SystemManager::SetDocumentation). Strux
// never reaches up for it.
//
// Two strings, on purpose:
//
//   DESCRIPTION   one line. It rides in the relay hello, so it is in a device list
//                 before anything asks the device a question. Sentence, not paragraph.
//
//   INSTRUCTIONS  free-form, as long as it needs to be, served only when asked for
//                 (`system describe`). Deliberately prose and NOT a schema: every
//                 command already declares its own name, arguments, types and
//                 required/optional state, and this is for the part that never fits
//                 in a declaration — which commands belong together, what order they
//                 go in, what the units are, what will not work and why.
//
// A fork replaces both when it replaces LedManager with a real feature.

    "Strux template device - an ESP32 reference firmware whose only feature is an "
    "LED that mirrors the relay link.";

inline constexpr const char* INSTRUCTIONS =
    "This is the Strux template firmware. It is a foundation for real products, so "
    "the only product-specific thing on it is a demonstration: an LED that is lit "
    "while the device is connected to its relay server and dark when it is not.\n"
    "\n"
    "Discovering what it can do\n"
    "  Every command declares itself. `help describe` returns every category, every "
    "command, and each command's arguments with their types and descriptions; "
    "`help list` is the same registry in smaller pieces. Nothing about a command is "
    "written down twice, so what those return is always this exact build.\n"
    "\n"
    "The demonstration feature\n"
    "  `led get` reports three separate facts: whether the indicator is enabled, "
    "whether the relay link is up, and whether the LED is lit at this instant. "
    "`led set -enabled false` keeps the board dark without affecting the link. The "
    "setting is persisted, so it survives a reboot.\n"
    "\n"
    "Settings\n"
    "  `settings list` enumerates every setting on the device with its type and "
    "current value; `settings set` changes one in RAM and `settings save` commits it "
    "to NVS. A change is not durable until it is saved. Keys are dotted "
    "(`relay.url`, `led.enabled`) and are at most 15 characters, which is a storage "
    "limit and not a style.\n"
    "\n"
    "Things worth knowing before driving this device\n"
    "  * `system reboot` answers first and then restarts about half a second later, "
    "so every connection drops and anything in flight is lost.\n"
    "  * The `partition` commands write flash. `partition write` and "
    "`partition clear` change what the device boots; they exist for firmware "
    "updates and are not a general storage API.\n"
    "  * `web read` serves the device's own web UI files. It is how the relay "
    "renders this device's page; it is not a filesystem.\n"
    "  * A command's reply is one JSON object unless the command says otherwise. "
    "`web read` and `partition read` are the exceptions: they write a header record "
    "and then raw bytes.\n"
    "  * Numbers in arguments are unsigned 32-bit. There are no floating-point "
    "arguments anywhere in the protocol.";
