// The worked example of an application manager. It owns the LED and uses it to say one
// thing: whether this device is connected to its relay server — lit while the pipe is
// up, dark while it is not. In doing so it touches every edge the layering allows and
// none that it forbids:
//
//   • the board, for the hardware        — app_.getBoard().GetLed()
//   • the framework, for the link state  — app_.getStrux().getRelayManager()
//   • the framework, for settings        — led.enabled, in the settings UI with no UI
//                                          code written
//   • the framework, for commands        — `led get` / `led set`, in `help list` and
//                                          reachable over WebSocket and the relay alike
//   • the framework, for telemetry       — a point when the indication is switched
//   • the framework, for its own UI      — a page and a dashboard card, declared here
//                                          and shipped as a module in www, loaded by
//                                          whichever shell the operator is looking at
//
// Note what it does NOT do: nothing in Strux knows this class exists. It is not named in
// StruxContext, not in StruxProvider, and not in main.cpp. It announces itself by
// registering, from its own Init(), into managers it found through AppProvider — and
// reading the link state needed no accessor added to RelayManager, because IsConnected()
// was already the framework's own idea of the answer. Copy this file to start a feature;
// delete it when the product has real ones.
