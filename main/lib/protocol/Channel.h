// A channel's stream, and the only thing that crosses the transport/dispatch
// boundary: a transport turns wire bytes into one of these, the dispatcher turns
// it into a handler call. There is no layer in between — a transport constructs a
// Channel on its own stack, feeds it the first chunk, and hands it to
// CommandManager::Execute.
//
// NEITHER DIRECTION IS SIZED BY THE TRANSPORT. write() splits the reply at
// whatever payload capacity it was handed, emitting non-final DATA chunks; read()
// pulls further chunks until one carries FLAG_FINAL. So a Channel of any length
// works over a link that frames in 256 bytes or 4096, and two peers on one link
// need not have chosen the same number. The only rule is the one a sender cannot
// break silently: a single chunk must fit the RECEIVER's buffer, which is why
// RecvChunk reports overrunning it as a channel fault rather than a dead link.
//
// read() = the request bytes; write() = the reply, accumulated and flushed as
// binary DATA chunks, closed by finish() with FLAG_FINAL. The reply is assembled
// directly into an EXTERNAL framing buffer (owned by the transport, off the
// task stack): payload goes after the 3-byte header slot, so a flush is one
// SendRaw with no extra copy.
//
// The request is a run of channel chunks that share this id: the first is fed
// up front (feedRequest); once it's drained, read() pulls further chunks off
// the link (RecvChunk) until a chunk carries FLAG_FINAL. A small no-body command
// is a single FLAG_FINAL chunk, so read() never blocks; a streamed upload is many
// chunks ending in FLAG_FINAL.
//
// Both buffers are also lent out as-is (Stream::canLend and friends), which is what
// lets a handler stream a firmware image to flash holding no buffer of its own.
// Where a frame goes when it is not ours.
//
// A handler reads its own request off the wire (see ensureInput below), so it is
// the thing holding the transport while other channels' frames arrive. It cannot
// run them -- a Connection serves one operation at a time -- but it must not
// destroy them either, which is what this interface is for: hand the frame to the
// Connection, let it update its table and refuse what it cannot serve, and carry
// on waiting for our own next chunk.
//
// Implemented by Connection. Optional only so that Channel stays usable without
// one; both transports pass one.
