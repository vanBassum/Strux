// The reply half of the handler's contract, mirroring the argument decoder on the
// request side: a handler names the SHAPE of what it is writing and never names the
// wire format.
//
//     CommandResult Cmd_Info(CommandContext& ctx)
//     {
//         auto resp = ctx.reply.object();
//         resp.field("name", deviceName);
//         resp.field("heapFree", esp_get_free_heap_size());
//     }
//
// Every scope comes from a factory method — the root from the writer, children from
// their parent — so a call site never spells a type. `auto` is enough, and the methods
// available at any point are exactly the ones the enclosing scope offers.
//
// Depth is not capped. A record may open another object or array, the same way today's
// JsonScope allows, because the alternative (a flat record, or a record plus one level
// of list) cannot express `help list` without changing its wire shape. The cost is that
// a second writer implementation owes the whole grammar; there is only one today.
//
// This is NOT a builder. Bytes reach the transport on every field, nothing is buffered
// and nothing can be revised. That is also why a scope is worth opening and closing
// rather than living for the handler's lifetime: a reply is a SEQUENCE of records, and
// `partition write` emits a progress record every few kilobytes before its result.
//
// The separator between records is the writer's, never a handler's. It is emitted
// lazily -- when a second root opens, or when flush() is called to push a record now --
// so an ordinary one-record reply carries no trailing separator and costs no extra
// frame. A handler that wants its record seen immediately says flush(); one that simply
// writes another record says nothing at all.
//
// A reply may end in a BODY of arbitrary bytes: `head.body("image/png")` declares the
// media type, seals the structured part and hands back the stream. That is the only
// way a handler reaches raw output, which is what keeps wire framing out of handlers --
// see ReplyBody.h for the convention it implements.
