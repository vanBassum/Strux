// The device's credential authority, as a manager of its own.
//
// It owns the password setting, the Authenticator (password check, resume-key
// table) and the `auth` command category. Nothing here is a transport:
// a transport borrows the Authenticator through the provider and puts an AuthGate
// in front of its own connection state.
//
// It lived under WebServerManager/ because that is where the HTTP/WS login was
// extracted from, which made RelayManager include WebServerManager.h to borrow a
// credential authority that was never the web server's — the last sideways edge
// between two transports, and the reason StruxContext::Init() carried an ordering
// constraint. Both are gone: a transport asks the provider, and this manager only
// has to come up after SettingsManager, like every other.
