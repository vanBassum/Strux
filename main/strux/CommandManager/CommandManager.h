// registry's own (`help`, which is the registry describing itself and
// could not live anywhere else). Every other command lives in the
// manager that owns its domain and is registered from that manager's
// Init().
//
// Deliberately knows nothing about channels, transports or the wire format: give
// it a read envelope and a stream and it runs the handler. It asks the envelope for
// a name and for a decode against the command's declarations, so the ONE place that
// knows a request is JSON is EnvelopeLine — which is what keeps this the one piece
// of the request path that can be reasoned about on its own.
//
// Reading a request's envelope is the protocol layer's job — see
// protocol::RunCommandChannel, which every transport calls.
